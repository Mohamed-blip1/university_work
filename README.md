# University Programming Exercises (C & Python)

This repository contains my **university TD (Travaux Dirigés)** and **TP (Travaux Pratiques)** solutions, written in **C** and **Python**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice fundamental programming concepts
- Translate mathematical algorithms into code
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Compare low-level (C) and high-level (Python) implementations
